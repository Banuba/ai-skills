# Video Templates on Android  

Templates let users create stunning videos quickly and easily using predefined sets of effects, transitions, and music. All it takes to make a shareable piece is changing the placeholders. With templates, even people who are new to video editing or just lack time can make impressive content in minutes.

The ```Video Templates``` is not enabled by default. Contact Banuba representatives to know more.

## Launch Video Templates

Use a new entry point in `VideoCreationActivity` to launch the Video Editor SDK from Video templates.

```kotlin
val intent = VideoCreationActivity.startFromTemplates(Context)
```

## Setup Custom Templates

:::important
Use this method if you have an agreement with Banuba for the delivery of additional templates and have received the corresponding URL. By default, the SDK is delivered with predefined configuration to load Banuba templates.
:::

Use `TemplatesConfig` to enable templates in your app.  
Two options are available — add `TemplatesConfig` to your Video Editor Koin module.

### By URL

```kotlin
single {
    TemplatesConfig(
        url = // your endpoint i.e. "https://"
    )
}
```

### By secret key

:::important
Requires a `secret` key provided by your Banuba representative.
:::

```kotlin
single {
    TemplatesConfig(
        url = "",
        secret = // set your secret key provided by Banuba
    )
}
```
