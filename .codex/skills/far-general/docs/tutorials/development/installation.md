- CocoaPods
- Swift Package Manager

## CocoaPods packages[​](#cocoapods-packages "Direct link to CocoaPods packages")

To start using **Banuba SDK** with [**CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html), add a **custom repository** and desired **packages** to your `Podfile`:

Podfile

```
loading...
```

![Icon](/img/icons/github.svg "GitHub")

Then install pods:

```
pod install --repo-update
```

See [banuba-sdk-podspecs](https://github.com/sdk-banuba/banuba-sdk-podspecs) repo for the list of all available packages and versions.

The complete example, configured for **CocoaPods** usage, can be found in our [Objective-C](https://github.com/Banuba/quickstart-ios-objc) quickstart example.

## SPM packages[​](#spm-packages "Direct link to SPM packages")

**Banuba SDK** provides [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) packages in the custom repositories.

Add **Banuba SDK** packages, to your Xcode project:

1. **File** > **Add Package Dependencies...**
2. Search for the package, for example <https://github.com/sdk-banuba/BNBSdkApi>
3. Press the **Add Package** button. After verifying the package, press **Add Package** again.

See the [sdk-banuba](https://github.com/sdk-banuba?tab=repositories\&q=swift+package\&type=\&language=\&sort=) repositories for the list of all available packages and versions.

The complete example, configured for **SPM** usage, can be found in our [Beauty-iOS](https://github.com/Banuba/banuba-sdk-ios-samples) quickstart example.

## How to choose required packages[​](#how-to-choose-required-packages "Direct link to How to choose required packages")

warning

Only use the packages with the same version! Packages with different versions (even minor) may conflict or work incorrectly with each other.

tip

If **feature** or **effect** works incorrect, see application **logs**, to figure out which package is missed.

Add packages depends on the specific **features** or **effects**, which your app will use. It is your responsibility to include everything required for the desired behaviour.<br /><!-- -->See detailed [packages description](#list-of-all-available-packages) in the table below.

Example of the packages set for [Face Tracking](/tutorials/capabilities/glossary.md#frx-face-tracking) and [Background Separation](/tutorials/capabilities/glossary.md#background-separation):

* BNBSdkApi
* BNBFaceTracker
* BNBBackground

## Bundlers[​](#bundlers "Direct link to Bundlers")

**[Banuba WebAR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@banuba/webar)** depends on `BanubaSDK.data` and `BanubaSDK.wasm` (or `BanubaSDK.simd.wasm` if you are targeting [SIMD](/tutorials/development/guides/optimization.md#speed-up-webar-sdk-on-modern-browsers)) files. By default the SDK expects these files to be accessible from the application root i.e. by the `/BanubaSDK.data`, `/BanubaSDK.wasm` `/BanubaSDK.simd.wasm` links. It must be taken into consideration when working with application bundlers like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Generally speaking one should be able to put `BanubaSDK.data`, `BanubaSDK.wasm` and `BanubaSDK.simd.wasm` files into the application assets folder (usually `public/`) and get the SDK loading these files properly.

But you may want to place the files somewhere else, that case the [locateFile](/generated/typedoc/types/SDKOptions.html) property of the [Player.create()](/generated/typedoc/classes/Player.html#create) method should help you to set-up SDK properly.

* Vite
* Rollup
* Webpack

### Vite[​](#vite "Direct link to Vite")

```
import { Player, Module /* ... */ } from "@banuba/webar"
// vite uses special ?url syntax to import files as URLs
import data from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.data?url"
import wasm from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.wasm?url"
import simd from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.simd.wasm?url"

import FaceTracker from "@banuba/webar/face_tracker.zip?url"
import Background from "@banuba/webar/background.zip?url"

// ...

const player = await Player.create({
  clientToken: "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  // point BanubaSDK where to find these vital files
  locateFile: {
    "BanubaSDK.data": data,
    "BanubaSDK.wasm": wasm,
    "BanubaSDK.simd.wasm": simd,
  },
})

await player.addModule(new Module(FaceTracker), new Module(Background))

// ...
```

tip

See Vite [Explicit URL imports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#explicit-url-imports) docs for details.

### Rollup[​](#rollup "Direct link to Rollup")

```
import { Player, Module /* ... */ } from "@banuba/webar"
// you need to set-up @rollup/plugin-url for the import syntax to work
import data from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.data"
import wasm from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.wasm"
import simd from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.simd.wasm"

import FaceTracker from "@banuba/webar/face_tracker.zip"
import Background from "@banuba/webar/background.zip"

// ...

const player = await Player.create({
  clientToken: "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  // point BanubaSDK where to find these vital files
  locateFile: {
    "BanubaSDK.data": data,
    "BanubaSDK.wasm": wasm,
    "BanubaSDK.simd.wasm": simd,
  },
})

await player.addModule(new Module(FaceTracker), new Module(Background))

// ...
```

tip

See [@rollup/plugin-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-url#include) docs for details.

### Webpack[​](#webpack "Direct link to Webpack")

Depending on the version of **Webpack** used, you may have to add following rule to the `module.rules` section of the `webpack.config.js`:

```
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...
      {
        test: /\.wasm$/,
        type: 'javascript/auto',
        loader: 'file-loader',
      },
      // ...
    ],
    },
  },
}
```

Now import of `.wasm` files as URLs should work properly:

```
import { Player, Module /* ... */ } from "@banuba/webar"
import data from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.data"
import wasm from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.wasm"
import simd from "@banuba/webar/BanubaSDK.simd.wasm"

import FaceTracker from "@banuba/webar/face_tracker.zip"
import Background from "@banuba/webar/background.zip"

// ...

const player = await Player.create({
  clientToken: "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  // point BanubaSDK where to find these vital files
  locateFile: {
    "BanubaSDK.data": data,
    "BanubaSDK.wasm": wasm,
    "BanubaSDK.simd.wasm": simd,
  },
})

await player.addModule(new Module(FaceTracker), new Module(Background))

// ...
```

info

See the related [Webpack issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7352) for details.

**Banuba SDK** for desktop platforms (i.e. **Windows** and **MacOS**) is distributed via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Banuba/FaceAR-SDK-desktop-releases/releases).

Release archives for **Windows** are packed in `.zip` (`bnd_sdk.zip`), for **MacOS** in `.tar.gz` (`bnb_sdk.tar.gz`).

Archives for **Windows** and **MacOS** contains identical C++ API, **MacOS** archive also contains **Objective-C** API identical to **iOS**. As usual, **Objecive-C** API is designed to be callable from **Swift**.
