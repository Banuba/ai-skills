## Customize configurations

```CameraConfig``` is a main class used to customize features, behavior and user experience for video recording on camera screen i.e. set min/max recording duration, flashlight, etc.  
Video editor includes default implementation but you can provide your own implementation to meet your requirements in [VideoEditorModule](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/example/integrationapp/VideoEditorModule.kt).  
For example, to sets max video recording duration to 30 seconds.
```kotlin
single(override = true) {
  CameraConfig(maxRecordedTotalVideoDurationMs = 30_000)
}
```

| maxRecordedTotalVideoDurationMs |                               Number > 0; Default ```120000```                               | maximum video recording duration *in milliseconds* available to record

| supportsMultiRecords |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | defines if the use can record multiple video subsequently. ```false```  when the first video recording is done the editing screen will be opened
| supportsFlashlight |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | enables flashlight icon on the camera screen and possibility to take a photo with flashlight
| supportsSpeedRecording |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | enables speed recording icon on the camera screen and possibility to select recording speed

| switchFacingOnDoubleTap |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | ```true``` allows to switch between front and back camera by double tap
| isStartFrontFacingFirst |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | ```true``` means that ```front``` camera facing is used on the first launch of the camera screen, ```false``` means that ```back``` camera facing is used on the first launch of the camera screen
| isSaveLastCameraFacing |                                true/false; Default ```true```                                | defines if the camera facing (```back``` or ```front```) is saved and restored
| cameraFpsMode |                 CameraFpsMode enum values; Default ```CameraFpsMode.FIXED```                 | ```CameraFpsMode.FIXED``` means that video recording quality can be degraded to maintain 30 FPS while applying "heavy" Face AR effects (*This behavior is recommended* and allows to reach seamless usage on wide range of devices). ```CameraFpsMode.ADAPTIVE``` means that FPS can be reduced in order to maintain video quality(not recommended).
| showCameraInfoAndPerformance |                               true/false; Default ```false```                                | enables debug views for showing camera system details such as current FPS, Iso etc.

| videoDurations | List&lt;Long&gt;; Default ```listOf(maxRecordedTotalVideoDurationMs, 60_000L, 30_000L, 15_000L)``` | defines the list of durations available to record. The user can see the option on the camera screen and pick new option. For example,  ```60000L``` means that the user can record a number of video with total duration no more than 60 seconds.
| supportsVideoDurationSwitcher | true/false; Default ```true```  | defines if video recording time interval swithced is enabled

## Configure microphone state

Use ```CameraMuteMicConfig``` if you want to customize default state of microphone on the camera screen.
Here is default implementation in [VideoEditorModule](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/example/integrationapp/VideoEditorModule.kt)
```kotlin
factory {
    CameraMuteMicConfig(
        // If mic should be muted when open camera screen in normal mode
        muteInNormalMode = false,
        // If mic should be muted when open camera screen in picture in picture mode
        muteInPipMode = true,
        // If mic should be muted when open camera screen with passed audio track
        muteWithAudioTrack = true 
    )
}
```

## Configure recording modes
Camera screen includes 3 modes for recording content implemented as ```RecordMode```
- ```Photo```
- ```Video```
- ```Photo``` and ```Video``` - default value

Implement ```CameraRecordingModesProvider``` in [VideoEditorModule](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/example/integrationapp/VideoEditorModule.kt) to customize mode that meets your requirements.
Default implementation is
```kotlin
single<CameraRecordingModesProvider> {
    object : CameraRecordingModesProvider {
        override var availableModes = setOf(RecordMode.Video, RecordMode.Photo)
    }
}
```
:::danger
```availableModes``` must not be empty, otherwise a crash will happen.

## Picture in picture
Picture in Picture or ```PIP``` is video editing technique that lets you overlay two videos in the same video.
The multi-layer editing effect is perfect for reaction videos, slideshows, product demos, and more. This feature is similar to TikTok duet feature.  

&nbsp;

:::info
The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled if the license supports it. Please ask Banuba business representatives to include the feature in your license.  
:::

The subsequent guide explains how to start and customize ```PIP```.  

First, pass ```pictureInPictureConfig``` in [VideoCreationActivity.startFromCamera](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/example/integrationapp/MainActivity.kt#L179-L194) method

```kotlin
val localVideoUri = ...
VideoCreationActivity.startFromCamera(
    context = this,
    // set PiP video configuration
    pictureInPictureConfig = PipConfig(
        video = localVideoUri,
        openPipSettings = false // if you want to open pip settings at startup
    )
)
```

```PIP``` includes 4 modes that you can use.
- ```Floating```
- ```TopBottom```
- ```React```
- ```LeftRight```

Implement ```PipLayoutProvider``` in [VideoEditorModule](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/banuba/example/integrationapp/VideoEditorModule.kt) to customize the order of modes and other capabilities. 
```kotlin
single<PipLayoutProvider> {
    object : PipLayoutProvider {
        override fun provide(
            insetsOffset: Int,
            screenSize: Size
        ): List<EditorPipLayoutSettings> {
            val context = androidContext()
            return listOf(
                EditorPipLayoutSettings.Floating(
                    context = context,
                    physicalScreenSize = screenSize,
                    topOffsetPx = context.dimen(R.dimen.pip_floating_top_offset) + insetsOffset
                ),
                EditorPipLayoutSettings.TopBottom(),
                EditorPipLayoutSettings.React(
                    context = context,
                    physicalScreenSize = screenSize,
                    topOffsetPx = context.dimen(R.dimen.pip_react_top_offset) + insetsOffset
                ),
                EditorPipLayoutSettings.LeftRight()
            )
        }
    }
}
```
Please do not forget to update [CameraMuteMicConfig](#configure-microphone-state) implementation if you want to change use of microphone in ```PIP```.  

You can even customize camera align for each mode and exclude actions for some modes:
```diff
...
    return listOf(
        EditorPipLayoutSettings.Floating(
            ...,
            excludeActions = listOf(
                EditorPipLayoutAction.SwitchVertical,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Square,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Round
            ),
            // highlight-add-next-line
+            isCameraAlignTop = false
        ),
        EditorPipLayoutSettings.TopBottom(
            excludeActions = listOf(
                EditorPipLayoutAction.SwitchVertical,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Original,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Centered
            ),
            // highlight-add-next-line
+            isCameraAlignTop = false
        ),
        EditorPipLayoutSettings.React(
            ...,
            excludeActions = listOf(
                EditorPipLayoutAction.SwitchVertical,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Square,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Round,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Centered,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Original
            ),
            isCameraMain = false
        ),
        EditorPipLayoutSettings.LeftRight(
            excludeActions = listOf(
                EditorPipLayoutAction.SwitchHorizontal,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Original,
                EditorPipLayoutAction.Centered
            ),
            // highlight-add-next-line
+            isCameraAlignLeft = false
        )
    )
```
