## Packages[​](#packages "Direct link to Packages")

**Maven**

To start using **Banuba SDK** , add a custom maven repo to your `build.gradle.kts`:

build.gradle.kts

```
loading...
```

Refer to our [Maven](https://nexus.banuba.net/#browse/browse:maven-releases) to find the list of all available packages and their versions.

## How to choose required packages[​](#how-to-choose-required-packages "Direct link to How to choose required packages")

warning

Use only the packages with the same version! Packages with different versions (even minor) may conflict or work incorrectly with each other.

tip

If **feature** or **effect** works incorrect, see application **logs**, to figure out which package is missed.

Add packages depends on the specific **features** or **effects**, which your app will use. It is your responsibility to include everything required for the desired behaviour.<br /><!-- -->See detailed [packages description](#list-of-all-available-packages) in the table below.
