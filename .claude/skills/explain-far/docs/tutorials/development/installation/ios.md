## CocoaPods packages[​](#cocoapods-packages "Direct link to CocoaPods packages")

To start using **Banuba SDK** with [**CocoaPods**](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html), add a **custom repository** and desired **packages** to your `Podfile`:

Podfile

```
loading...
```

![Icon](/img/icons/github.svg "GitHub")

Then install pods:

```
pod install --repo-update
```

See [banuba-sdk-podspecs](https://github.com/sdk-banuba/banuba-sdk-podspecs) repo for the list of all available packages and versions.

The complete example, configured for **CocoaPods** usage, can be found in our [Objective-C](https://github.com/Banuba/quickstart-ios-objc) quickstart example.

## SPM packages[​](#spm-packages "Direct link to SPM packages")

**Banuba SDK** provides [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) packages in the custom repositories.

Add **Banuba SDK** packages, to your Xcode project:

1. **File** > **Add Package Dependencies...**
2. Search for the package, for example <https://github.com/sdk-banuba/BNBSdkApi>
3. Press the **Add Package** button. After verifying the package, press **Add Package** again.

See the [sdk-banuba](https://github.com/sdk-banuba?tab=repositories\&q=swift+package\&type=\&language=\&sort=) repositories for the list of all available packages and versions.

The complete example, configured for **SPM** usage, can be found in our [Beauty-iOS](https://github.com/Banuba/banuba-sdk-ios-samples) quickstart example.

## How to choose required packages[​](#how-to-choose-required-packages "Direct link to How to choose required packages")

warning

Only use the packages with the same version! Packages with different versions (even minor) may conflict or work incorrectly with each other.

tip

If **feature** or **effect** works incorrect, see application **logs**, to figure out which package is missed.

Add packages depends on the specific **features** or **effects**, which your app will use. It is your responsibility to include everything required for the desired behaviour.<br /><!-- -->See detailed [packages description](#list-of-all-available-packages) in the table below.

Example of the packages set for [Face Tracking](/tutorials/capabilities/glossary.md#frx-face-tracking) and [Background Separation](/tutorials/capabilities/glossary.md#background-separation):

* BNBSdkApi
* BNBFaceTracker
* BNBBackground
